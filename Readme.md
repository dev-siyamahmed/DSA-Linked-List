# Singly Linked List Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in JavaScript. The **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure where each node points to the next node, making it ideal for dynamic memory allocation and various algorithms like stacks, queues, and more.

This README will guide you through the steps to understand, use, and contribute to this Singly Linked List implementation.

## Overview

A **Singly Linked List** is a data structure that stores values in a series of nodes. Each node contains two properties:
1. A **value**: The data stored in the node.
2. A **next**: A pointer to the next node in the list. If it's the last node, this pointer is `null`.

The list starts from a **head** node and ends at a **tail** node. The size of the list is tracked by a length property.

## Features

- **Push**: Adds a new node at the end of the list.
- **Pop**: Removes the last node and returns it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the list is empty.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The list dynamically grows and shrinks as nodes are added or removed.

## Installation

To use this **Singly Linked List** implementation, you can simply clone or download this repository. There is no external dependency required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/singly-linked-list.git


## Key Points:

- The **README.md** provides a **detailed explanation** of the **Singly Linked List** implementation.
- It covers **installation**, **usage**, and **method descriptions**.
- It includes an **example** to demonstrate how to use the linked list.

Let me know if you'd like any changes or further enhancements to the README file!


## Conclusion
 This implementation provides a basic but functional Singly Linked List with essential methods like push, pop, and isEmpty. You can extend this implementation by adding more methods, such as insert, remove, search, and more, to suit your needs.
